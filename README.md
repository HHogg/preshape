## Why?

I, like many developers, would frequently start side projects and small experiments and abandon them either in the setup or polishing stages. Leaving me with nothing but a directory that I'm never going to open again.

I realised this was down to losing interest with repetitive UI tasks and not having an environment set up that was tailored to the way I develop. I also wanted a design that way minimal, flexible for a range of projects, and had it's own identity.

## How To Use

As mentioned above, this exists primarily for my own use but anybody is welcome to use it. The [Style Guide](https://preshape.hogg.io/) exists to validate and build components but it also has some basic documentation to get started.
