                  A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous
                  spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The
                  nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible
                  to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a
                  multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their
                  immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent
                  stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the
                  brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have
                  assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and
                  provide standardized stellar designations. The observable
                  Universe contains an estimated 1Ã—1024 stars, but most are
                  invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars
                  outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

                  The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
                  nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective
                  motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.
                  It is by far the most important source of energy for life on
                  Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000
                  miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about
                  330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of
                  the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of
                  the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly
                  helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier
                  elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

                  The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits Earth as its only
                  natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest satellite in the
                  Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites
                  relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its
                  primary). The Moon is, after Jupiter's satellite Io, the
                  second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose
                  densities are known. The Moon is thought to have formed about
                  4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely
                  accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris
                  left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized
                  body called Theia. New research of Moon rocks, although not
                  rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be
                  older than previously thought.
