          About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started
          to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined
          into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions
          is called chemistry.

          About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain
          molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures
          called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology. About
          70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens
          started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. The
          subsequent development of these human cultures is called history.
