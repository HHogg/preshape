/**
 * https://github.com/artsy/fresnel
 * Fresnel is a React library that uses media queries to
 * conditionally render components based on the current device.
 *
 * One drawback is that it renders an empty div which interferes
 * with the layout. When it's empty we hide it, so it's removed
 * from things like flexbox calculations.
