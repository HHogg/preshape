              Matter, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as
              the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our
              universe is called physics..

            reached a great height in the atmosphere.

            About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy
            started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which
            then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and
            their interactions is called chemistry.

            About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain
            molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate
            structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called
            biology. About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species
            Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called
            cultures. The subsequent development of these human cultures is
            called history.
